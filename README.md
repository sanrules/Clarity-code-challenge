The first script - *HostProcessorScript* - is designed to admit args. If none of them are passed, or they are invalid, they can be introduced manually through the console.

The second script - *UnlimitedProcessorScript* - is designed to run with args.

*LogGenerator* is a small tool to generate logs for myself in order to test the second script.
